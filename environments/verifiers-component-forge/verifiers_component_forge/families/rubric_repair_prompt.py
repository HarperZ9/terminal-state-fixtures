"""Prose renderer for rubric-repair instances.

Renders entirely from the FROZEN entry: the REWARD.md contract prose (shared
verbatim with the rubric-contract family), the broken module inline, the
frozen symptom (observed vs expected on one visible row), and the three
visible expected rows. Eval-time rendering never re-executes anything.
